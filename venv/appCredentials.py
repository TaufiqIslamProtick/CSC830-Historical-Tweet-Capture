1. The devEnvLabel is the name of the environment that you create for the sandbox for the Full Archive search. You can create the environment
    here: https://developer.twitter.com/en/account/environments
2. The environment requires the developer account to add one app to use in this environment. You can create a new app to use
    in this environment XOR use an existing app.
3. To use the sandbox, you need to generate a bearer token. The bearer token can be generated by the following cURL command:
    curl -u '<API Key>:<API Secret Key>'   --data 'grant_type=client_credentials'   'https://api.twitter.com/oauth2/token'
    Use the app's API key and API secret key that you just created in <API Key> and <API Secret Key> respectively.
